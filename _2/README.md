Synopsis: mainly, this tutorial focuses on control flows and iterators/loops.
The set of examples involve diverse iterable objects.

Specifically, the set of scripts cover the following points:

+   for loops (see [`for_loop.py`](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/intro-to-Python-SMM692/blob/master/_2/for_loop.py))
+   while loop (see [`while_loop.py`](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/intro-to-Python-SMM692/blob/master/_2/while_loop.py))
+   conditional for loops (see [`control_flow.py`](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/intro-to-Python-SMM692/blob/master/_2/control_flow.py))
+   list comprehensions (see [`list_comprenehsions.py`](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/intro-to-Python-SMM692/blob/master/_2/list_comprehensions.py))
